## Part 2: Practical Projects

### üîπ Edge AI Prototype
- Trained MobileNetV2 on recyclable waste images
- Converted to `.tflite` and tested locally
- Achieved ~85% accuracy in <10MB size

### üîπ AI-Driven IoT: Smart Agriculture
- Sensors: soil moisture, pH, humidity, sunlight
- LSTM model predicts crop yields from time-series data
- Includes system architecture diagram

### üîπ AI Ethics in Personalized Medicine
- Identified bias in TCGA (underrepresented ethnicities)
- Proposed fairness strategies (diverse datasets, model auditing)

## Part 3: Futuristic Proposal

**NeuralSense (2030)**:  
A brain-connected, emotionally-aware AI companion that helps users with mental health, focus, and mood regulation using EEG and multimodal models.

---

## Bonus: Quantum AI Simulation

- Built 2-qubit entangled circuit using Qiskit
- Demonstrated concept of superposition in molecular state simulation
- Discussed applications in AI-powered drug discovery

## How to Run

1. Run `train_model.ipynb` to train and save the `.h5` model  
2. Use `convert_to_tflite.py` to generate the `.tflite` file  
3. Run `test_tflite_model.py` with a sample image  
4. Run quantum circuit using IBM Quantum Lab or local Qiskit setup
